# jobwave

Jobwave is a LinkedIn-like application dedicated to seasonal workers and employers. 

It is a platform where seasonal workers can create a profile, search for jobs, and apply to them. 

Employers can create a profile, post jobs, and view applications.

Both can rate each-others profiles.

This repository contains some documentation about Jobwave architecture and design.
