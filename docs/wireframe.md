# Wireframe

This page consists of Jobwave's wireframes. It is a first draft of the user interface.

This draft is made with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), a collaborative design tool. It is available [here](https://www.figma.com/file/wqQH0DIfmjoXJZ4GVbqvrB/Advanced-Web?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=tXrX8QoT9VVSaWmz-0).

This draft is very bare-bone, showing only what is necessary to understand the user interface. It is not a final design.
